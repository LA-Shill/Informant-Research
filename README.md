 Informant is an academic web-based contactless 'active' reconnaissance asset discovery and vulnerability assessment platform. Utilising scan data from various Internet-wide scanning and passive DNS projects to discover and evaluate the security of a given exposed Internet-facing attack surface.  The tool can be found <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">here</a>.
<p align="center">
      The Informant platform has been developed as part of my final year degree Hons project. All research and background information surrounding the tool can be found within the repository. The overall aim was to design, produce and evaluate a non-intrusive asset discovery and vulnerability assessment tool capable of effectively identifying known-vulnerabilities in exposed Internet-connected devices.</p>
